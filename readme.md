# Bulk File Renaming

This Python project allows you to easily rename multiple files in a specified directory. It's a handy tool for batch renaming files according to a specific pattern.

## How to Use

1. Create a folder containing the files you want to rename.

2. Update the `path` variable in the `main.py` script to point to the folder where your files are located.

3. Run the `main.py` script.

4. The script will rename all files in the specified folder according to the pattern you define. By default, it renames files to "Test1.png," "Test2.png," and so on. You can customize the renaming pattern by modifying the `my_dest` variable.

5. The renamed files will be in the same folder as the original files.

## Example

Suppose you have a folder named "rename" containing the following files:
- file1.jpg
- file2.jpg
- file3.jpg

After running the script, the files will be renamed to:
- Test1.png
- Test2.png
- Test3.png
